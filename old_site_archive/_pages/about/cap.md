<h2>Overview of the service</h2>

Christians Against Poverty is a national debt counselling charity with a network of debt centres based in local churches.

<h3>Fact finding</h3>

Your local CAP representative will visit you in your home. They will introduce the service and ask you about your income, bills and debts. This information will be used to create a budget for you.

<h3>Additional visits: explaining the budget</h3>

Your local CAP representative will need to visit you again to explain how you will need to stick to the budget to get out of debt.

<h3>Continuous support</h3>

The next step is for CAP to contact your secondary creditors, such as credit card and loan companies. CAP will support you until you become debt free and all we ask you to do is to work positively with us through this process.
 
Call <strong>0800 328 0006</strong> to book an appointment with our Belper Debt Centre.
