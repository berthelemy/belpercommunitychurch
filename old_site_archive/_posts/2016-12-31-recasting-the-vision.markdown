2017 seems to be building to be a significant year so we will launch the beginning of the year with both a look back on the last year and a look forward to all the God has for us!
 <!--more-->
 
If we’re in the purposes of God the right question isn’t necessarily “what’s the vision?” it is perhaps “where is the growth and what’s the next step?”. I hope this season of vision casting will inspire us and our people to ask: “What’s next Lord?”
 
So, here is an outline of some of the things in the pipeline…
 
## Vision Month

We are taking the five Sundays from 8th Jan – 5th Feb to talk vision, growth and more.
 
## EMCF Celebration

The Recasting the Vision season builds towards an EMCF Celebration on Sunday 12th February, back in the morning (10.30am) at The Riverside Centre. We have guest speakers, Steve and Angie Campbell from C3 in Cambridge, with us that day.
 
## Prayer and Fasting

Later in the spring of 2017 we are planning a lent season of Prayer and Fasting – similar to previous years where we have done this across EMCF.
