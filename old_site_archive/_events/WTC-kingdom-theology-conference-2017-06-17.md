Westminter Theological Centre's upcoming Kingdom Theology Conference may be of interest to many of us, given our current theme of "The Kingdom of God".

Scot McKnight will be joining as keynote speaker, sharing on a number of topics, such as Paul as Pastor, the Church & Slavery and being Open to the Spirit.

Scot is a Professor of New Testament at Northern Seminary in Lombard IL.  He is an expert on early Christianity and the historical Jesus, and author or editor of over fifty books. Scot regularly speaks at local churches, conferences, colleges, and seminaries in the USA and abroad, and is a gifted and engaging communicator, being able to apply deep theological truths to real life.
