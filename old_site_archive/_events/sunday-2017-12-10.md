Today we will be joined by Mark Mumford and saying thanks to Henry, Anne-Marie, Alex, Rob, Anne &amp; Malcolm, who are stepping back from the leadership team.

We will be praying in the new team: Sarah, Mark, Gosia, Riaan &amp; Claire.

Also, we'll be saying goodbye to Darren & Rachel as they leave for Germany.

Please make every effort to be there.
