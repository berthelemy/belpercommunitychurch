We keep one Sunday a month clear so we can use the time to build relationships with our friends and neighbours.

Sometimes, particular during the warmer months, this will be a picnic and games in a local park.

More often, this is likely to be things like walks, bike rides, meeting up for coffee, or a meal. Sometimes in larger groups, but also just singly or in family groups.
