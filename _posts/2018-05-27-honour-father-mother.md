We looked today at how our culture treats older people, and how, as Christians, we are called to be counter-cultural. 

What does it mean in practice to defer to people who are older and wiser?

<em>F</em>orgive them
<em>S</em>peak well of them
<em>S</em>eek their wisdom
<em>P</em>rovide for them
<em>S</em>upport them

Mark's talk today was heavily based on <a href="http://kings.church/teaching/honor-your-father-and-mother/" target="_blank">Andrew Wilson's sermon</a> on the same subject (although adapted for our audience!). Watch the video below.
