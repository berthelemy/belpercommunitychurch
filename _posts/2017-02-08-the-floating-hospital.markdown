It's the story of the friendship between 15-year-old British girl, Iona, who lives on a floating hospital that sails the world, and Grace, a Congolese teenager who visits as a patient.

The ship is the Africa Mercy, part of the <a href="https://www.mercyships.org.uk/" target="_blank">Mercy Ships</a> ministry.
