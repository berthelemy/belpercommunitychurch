The Kingdom of God is a theme that runs all the way through the Bible. And for Jesus it was absolutely key. It was a central part of his preaching and teaching, as he encouraged people to become part of the Kingdom of God.

That’s why we’re doing a whole series of talks on it this term. We want to get to grips with what the Kingdom of God means in Belper - and how we can help people to become part of it.

## Key points to take away

- We are all Christ’s ambassadors.
- The Kingdom of God is counter-cultural
- But it’s worth it!

## What is the Kingdom like?

Jesus proclaimed the good news of the kingdom everywhere he went...

- "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.”
- “It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth. Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.”
- "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."
- “Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”

## Ambassadors

Being part of a kingdom means following the King. Taking his lead in every part of our lives, carrying his flag with us, and being his ambassadors. It’s not something to be ashamed of or scared about.

Just like an ambassador for a country, everything we do reflects on the Kingdom we’re part of, and everything we do is on behalf of that Kingdom.

## Upside-down

The people in Israel were expecting a king. They had been looking for one for many years and he was going to be it. They were going to go back to the glory days of when David was King, Israel was powerful and they didn’t have the Romans occupying their land.

But it was not like they imagined…
Jesus kingdom is an upside-down kingdom.
Just when Jesus was at his peak - when thousands of people would listen to him in one session - he rode into the capital city. It was the heart of the power of the Romans in Israel. He should have ridden in on a great horse to lead an army…

But, instead, he rode a donkey.

In those days a king riding on a donkey was a symbol of peace, not war.
When Jesus should have been leading the rebellion they expected, he allowed himself to be captured and killed on a cross.

It wasn’t what they were expecting, it was upside-down.

Jesus had talked about this upside-down Kingdom when he’d started teaching people:

 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
 Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
 Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
 Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
 
The people that will see the Kingdom of God will be those who have given up everything for the sake of their King.
They are those who are poor, those who mourn, those who are persecuted.

Jesus said: “Whoever wants to be my follower must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self?
[Luke 9:23-25]

Jesus calls us all to allow him to rule in every part of our lives.

What does that mean for us here? Living here, in the UK is a very comfortable place to live for many of us. We don’t often know what it is to be poor in spirit, to mourn, to be meek, to hunger and thirst for righteousness. We see things on the news that happen to other people, but how often does that affect us?

He told them to go into Jerusalem (their local town), Samaria (to people that are different to us) and to the ends of the earth (self-explanatory). He told them to make a difference, to be visible, to be salt and light in the world.

How easy it is to be comfortable! To ignore those challenges. Yet, in my experience, those who see the Kingdom and know Jesus best are those who have given up the most, who have been through the greatest challenges in life. These are people who know what it means to put Jesus first.

## Action points

1. Hear what God is saying to us, now about where he wants us to be, what his upside-down kingdom looks like
2. Call on Jesus when we see injustice, sickness or evil in the world - don’t just watch it on the news. Get involved.
3. Speak about the upside-down kingdom in our workplaces, schools and homes, including with people who are different to us
4. Do acts of unexpected kindness, with no thought for what we might get

Living in the Kingdom of God will probably mean that we go in a different direction to the rest of our culture. We will be living by God’s values - in the upside-down Kingdom. It may mean a life of poverty, pain or persecution. But it is worth giving up everything for the Kingdom. Is there anything that you are holding back? Is there anywhere in your life where you need to change your priorities? Is there anything that has taken Jesus’ place as King in your life? Do you need to offer your loyalty again to the King?

If we’re not sure about where our priorities are just think about two things: How do we spend our time, and how do we spend our money? Those two things will indicate what we put above everything else. What we worship.
Do you want to be part of Jesus’ upside-down kingdom? It’s a choice that we make.

## It's worth it

Just like the person who sold everything to get the treasure in the field - the Kingdom of God is worth giving everything for!
