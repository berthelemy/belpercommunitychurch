Mark Mumford spoke this morning as part of EMCF's Recasting the Vision month
<!--more-->

He spoke about the significance of "identity" - knowing who we are, both individually and corporately.

We find our true identity...

- 'in Christ' (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A14-22" target="_blank" title="Bible Gateway">Ephesians 2:14-22</a>)
- in family
- through belonging

He left us with three questions:

1. Am I secure in who I am?
2. Do I help others to belong?
3. Am I confident in belonging to this church?

### The dream

... that EMCF is a place for all individuals to know that they are welcomed and can fully belong to a caring, vibrant family.

... that together as EMCF, local churches know that they are part of a large and growing family.
