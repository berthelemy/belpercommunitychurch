<h2>What is a chaplain?</h2>

A person who interacts with people for their emotional and spiritual well-being.

A person who offers non-judgmental support about all aspects of life and work.

Chaplains are motivated by the Christian faith from which they come to care for people and communities.

They are not there to preach but to offer care and comfort and a listening ear
