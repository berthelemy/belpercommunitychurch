<h2>What is a chaplain?</h2>

<p>A person who interacts with people for their emotional and spiritual well-being.</p>

<p>A person who offers non-judgmental support about all aspects of life and work.</p>

<p>Chaplains are motivated by the Christian faith from which they come to care for people and communities.</p>

<p>They are not there to preach but to offer care and comfort and a listening ear.</p>
