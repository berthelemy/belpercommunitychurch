    <h2 class="title">Our vision</h2>     
    <p>To be filled with God’s presence and power, through which lives and communities will be transformed.</p>
    <p>As a family, we want people to be encouraged, through discipleship, to be authentic followers of Jesus, so that they can play their full part in God’s plan.</p>
    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>We are a truly intergenerational family from newborns to grannies and grandads!</p>
    <p>We are more than a Sunday morning church; getting together regularly in weekly smaller groups, over kitchen tables, in coffee shops, pubs and elsewhere.</p>
