                        <p>We are a group of people from all kinds of backgrounds who are committed to living out the Christian faith in a relevant and practical way.</p>
<h2><b>Our vision is&#8230; </b></h2>
<p>… to be filled with God’s presence and power, through which lives and communities will be transformed.</p>
<p>As a family, we want people to be encouraged, through discipleship, to be authentic followers of Jesus, so that they can play their full part in God’s plan.</p>
<h2><b>Our values are…</b></h2>
<ol>

<li><b>Family: </b>Belper Community Church is a safe place where everyone knows they belong.</li>
<li><b>Mission: </b>For members of BCC to be a positive witness to Christ in their day-to-day lives. We expect this to be accompanied by demonstrations of God’s power both in church and outside.</li>

<p>We work in many practical ways along side other churches in Belper. We are also part of <a title="East Midlands Christian Fellowships" href="http://www.emcf.net" target="_blank">East Midlands Christian Fellowships</a> on a regional level, and <a title="Salt and Light Ministries" href="http://europe.saltlight.org/" target="_blank">Salt and Light Ministries</a> on an international level.</p>

<p>We want to reach out to others and share the love of God with them, both through what we are saying and what we do. We are a truly intergenerational family from newborns to grannies and grandads! We look to be more than a Sunday morning church; getting together regularly in weekly smaller groups.</p>
<p>Belper Community Church started around a couple who became Christians on Alpha. A few years later, along with friendships, new babies and God-inspired connections and moves, the family is growing rapidly so that we have moved to meet at the Whitemoor Centre.</p>
