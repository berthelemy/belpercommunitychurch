We usually meet together as a whole church on the 1st, 2nd and 4th Sundays of each month. This is an important time to worship God together, and to hear from Him - so we're ready for the week ahead.

We also have a number of small groups &mdash; often meeting in people's homes, or local pubs or coffee shops during the week &mdash; for prayer, bible study and food!

On the 3rd Sundays, we take the opportunity to meet in our groups, often for social events to which we can invite friends.

When there is a fifth Sunday, we will often get together for a short family-focussed prayer time.
