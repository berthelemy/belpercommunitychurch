We usually meet together as a whole church on the 1st, 2nd and 4th Sundays of each month.

On the 3rd Sundays, we take the opportunity to meet in our groups, often for social events to which we can invite friends.

When there is a fifth Sunday, we will often get together for a short family-focussed prayer time.
