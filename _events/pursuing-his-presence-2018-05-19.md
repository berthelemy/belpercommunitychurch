We have been invited to join Jubilee Church at Pursuing His Presence : The Conference which takes place on the 19 May 2018 at The Riverside Centre in Derby. They’ve hosted this conference for the last few years and it has been very well received. Once again in 2018 they will be opening this up to all churches across the city and further afield. 

It’s a day for all those hungry to pursue the presence of God and grow in the area of the prophetic. Join them for a day of equipping and encounter, with teams experienced in hosting the presence of God and enabling others to encounter His presence for themselves. 

Their passion is to help people and church communities discover how we can all play a unique part in bringing the Kingdom message to the world around us. The teams include a number of people who are gifted in the area of prophetic ministry, whose conviction is that God wants to speak to all of us.

The sessions will be helpful for anybody who is hungry to deepen their relationship with God and discover how He communicates His heart and purposes to us in so many different ways.

The speakers will include Andy Robinson, David Fellingham, Jo McCulloch, Dave Price and Graham Pyman. The event will be served by teams from Jubilee Church Derby and Kings Church Horsham. 

As well as the main sessions and times of worship, there will be a number of seminars during the day. [Please see the website](https://www.jubilee.org.uk/pursuing-his-presence/) for more details.
