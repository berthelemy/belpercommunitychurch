Join one of the <a href="http://www.leabunnyrun.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lea Bunny Runs</a> in the morning, or walk in the bluebell woods around Lea.

If you would like to use this opportunity to raise money for <a href="http://www.reaperministries.org.uk/reaper-ministries-in-action/action-in-malawi/good-hope-school-malawi/" target="_blank">Good Hope Primary School</a> in Malawi, then please <a href="/assets/SponsorsfortheFunRun.docx.pdf" target="_blank">download a sponsorship form</a>.

The run starts at 11:00 - you will need to <a href="http://www.leabunnyrun.co.uk/" target="_blank">register</a> in advance.

Or meet at Lea Bridge at 11:00 for the bluebell walk.

From 12:30 - 2pm, we'll meet up at Allan &amp; Annette's house nearby for a shared lunch.

Then, after lunch, we'll gather together for a family prayer time.
