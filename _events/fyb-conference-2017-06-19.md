# Keeping in Step with the Spirit (Gal 5:25)

## 19th June to 23rd June 2017

Speakers will include Dr Rich Roberts and both Roy and Daphne Godwin.

During this years&rsquo; June Conference, participants will be considering the injunction to &lsquo;keep in step with the Spirit and what it might mean for our character and lives. How do we do it? What impact should it produce in the lives and communities around us? What is our role in the world during 2017 and beyond? These are extraordinary days and we will be lost if we fail to keep in step with the Spirit.

When we keep in step with the Spirit we tend to find others who are doing exactly the same as us. Families, tribes and nations are born.

This year&rsquo;s June Conference will also include sessions for those who are interested in connecting with Ffald y Brenin through The Caleb Connection. Wednesday will include the Friends of Ffald y Brenin annual Day. A separate elective may be available for those wishing to learn about their Local House of Prayer network.

The Conference commences with a meal at 6pm on Monday June 19<sup>th</sup> and concludes at noon on Friday 23<sup>rd</sup>. Afternoons are free for reflection or exploration of Ffald y Brenin, the hills, beaches and woods of the area.

They request a donation of &pound;112 per person as a Conference Fee which includes Evening Meals but excludes your accommodation in a local B&amp;B.
