The next Deeper bible study will be at Joel and Alison's house at 8pm Maundy Thursday (29th March 2018).

We'll be taking a look at <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17&version=NIV" target="_blank" title="John 17 on Bible Gateway">John 17</a>, and what Jesus is hoping for in his bride... using the brothers from the parable of the prodigal son as a lens to help us on our way.

If you are intending to attend please RSVP to Joel.
