The Welcome Banquet 2017 will take place on 21 October at the Riverside Centre in Pride Park. All funds raised will go to the work of Upbeat Communities. We are a charity that welcomes refugees and asylum seekers to Derby, helping strangers become neighbours.

Last year's banquet was a huge success, with thousands raised for Upbeat activities including free English classes, skills training and visits to new arrivals.

The Riverside Centre will once again be our venue as we gather to eat, drink, and hear about the work Upbeat Communities is doing in the city.

Graham Penny (star of Homes Under the Hammer) will return to proceedings as auctioneer, and diners will have a chance to capture the night in a photo booth. This time around, the theme of the banquet is 'CIRCUS', with aerial performers, fire-eaters and carnival games all featuring.

The evening will include:

BIG TOP PERFORMERS, FAIRGROUND STALLS, LUXURY BUFFET, CIRCUS THEMED PHOTO BOOTH, CHARITY AUCTION AND MORE!

21 October 2017. Complimentary welcome drink served from 7pm. Cash bar available.

Tickets: Single tickets: Â£27.50 (including booking fees) or book a table at a discount.

VIP tables available.
