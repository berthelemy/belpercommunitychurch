Join our friends Duncan and Kate Smith of Catch the Fire this October, accompanied by special guest Carol Arnott.

Their heart is to reach the world with Jesus through the sharing of our values, equipping people, and releasing them to bring revival to their nations.

EMCF have welcomed them many times to share with us prophetically and with Father Heart ministry they carry. They are a gift to the body of Christ.

There is a variety of day and conference tickets available, including concessionary and married couple tickets. You can book on to the conference at https://ccderby.churchapp.co.uk/events/uvx3a0oz
