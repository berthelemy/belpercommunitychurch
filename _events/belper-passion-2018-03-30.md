After a three year break, the hugely successful Belper Passion play returns to the streets and churches of the town in 2018.

The performance will see a move to a traditional setting with Roman soldiers and costumes of the period. With a new director, Jannice Richtof, and a new script by George Gunby, the performance is being produced by Churches Together in Belper.

The event will include The Walk Of Witness which has attracted up to 800 people in the past. 

The Belper Passion Walk of Witness starts from outside HSBC Bank, King Street at 11:00.

Followed by the Passion Play at 11:45am in St Peterâ€™s Church.

*Free admission*
